    <p id="introp">Hello, I’m [<b>Saimon</b>], and I’m a writer. <br>

        I’ve been writing for a while now, and it’s become an integral part of my life. My passion for writing started when I was in elementary school. I got a pen and paper and wrote down everything that popped into my head—I couldn’t stop! <br>
        
        As my writing skills improved, so did my confidence as a writer. At first, people thought I was just a kid with a lot of energy; but now they see that writing is more than just something fun to do—it’s something that makes me happy, and gives me clarity on what I want out of life, and helps me make sense of the world around me. <br>
        
        So if you’re interested in hiring me as your writer or if you have any questions about what it’s like to work with me, please feel free to reach out!</p>
